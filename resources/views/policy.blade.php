                This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") explains how 2080 Media, Inc., including {{@$seo->site_name}} Network 
                and PlayOn! Sports (together, "{{@$seo->site_name}}," "us," "our," and "we") uses your information when you use 
                our products and services such as visiting any of our websites ("Sites"); use a mobile application, 
                API, and similar or other tools that link to this Privacy Policy ("App"); or otherwise provide us 
                information (e.g., by calling customer service, submitting a resume or work application or emailing us) 
                (collectively, the "Services"). Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites, mobile applications 
                or other online services not listed above. For example, our Privacy Policy does not apply to services 
                offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in 
                search results, sites that may include {{@$seo->site_name}} Services, or other sites linked from our Services. Our Privacy 
                Policy also does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our 
                Services and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads. You 
                should review the privacy policies of those third parties.
              </p> <p>
                This Privacy Policy is part of the terms and conditions of the use of the Services ("Terms of Use"). You 
                can find out more information regarding your rights and responsibilities in using the Services by reviewing our

                {{@$seo->site_name}} is committed to protecting your privacy. All disclosures of information from you to {{@$seo->site_name}} are voluntary, 
                and by accessing our Sites or Apps, otherwise using our Services, or sending us information, you consent to 
                our information practices.

                We receive and store information, including personal information, about you and your use of our Services. This 
                information is gathered in a number of ways, including when you enter it on one of our Sites and from 
                interactions with our Services. We collect two types of information: Personal Information and Non-Personal 
                Information. "Personal Information" is information that identifies you or can reasonably be used to uniquely 
                identify you. "Non-Personal Information" is all other information—it does not identify you. When you interact 
                with us, we may ask you to supply us with Personal Information so that we can provide, enhance and personalize 
                our Services and marketing efforts. We may combine the Personal Information you provide us with publicly available 
                information about you as well as information from other sources.
              </p> <p><i>Information from You</i></p> <p>
                We may collect information directly from you in a number of ways including through a Site or App or if you call 
                or email us (e.g., by calling customer service or emailing us your resume). Some of our Services require you to 
                become a member or otherwise sign up for an account (an "Account"). When you do, we’ll collect Personal Information 
                like your name, email, credit card number, address, phone number and other information. If you want to take advantage 
                of any public sharing features we may offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible profile, which may 
                include your name and photo and other information. The type of information that you provide to us will vary depending 
                on the reason for the disclosure and Service provided, but may include things like:
              </p> <ol><li>
                  Contact information, such as name, email address, postal address, and mobile
                  number.

                  User name (which may be your email address), password and security
                  information to help us identify you.
                </li> <li>Age and date of birth.</li> <li>Other demographic information such as gender, job information, and zip code.</li> <li>
                  Your preferences, such as favorite schools you would like to follow or preferred
                  channels on a Site or App.
                </li> <li>
                  Communications preferences, such as which newsletters you would like to
                  receive.

                  Payment and identity verification information, such as a credit card number and
                  related information.
                </li> <li>
                  Contact information about others that you choose to provide (e.g., to refer a
                  friend).
                </li> <li>Correspondence, images or other media you send to us.</li> <li>
                  Comments or information that you leave on a Site, in an App, or in a profile that
                  are publicly visible.
                </li></ol> <p><i>Information from Other Entities</i></p> <p>
                We also may receive information from other entities. Some of our Services may involve obtaining 
                information from other entities such as credit reporting agencies, media companies, or companies 
                that provide services or products to you such as devices or mobile device apps. In the case of 
                some Services, we may receive this information based on an express or implied consent from you. 
                In other cases, we may receive information that is publicly available.
              </p> <p><i>Information from Your Use of our Services</i></p> <p>
                We may collect information about the Services that you use and how you use them.
                This information includes:
              </p> <ol><li><strong>Device information.</strong> We may collect device-specific information (such as your
                  hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile
                  network information including phone number). {{@$seo->site_name}} may associate your device
                  identifiers or phone number with your Account.
                </li> <li><strong>Log information.</strong> When you use our Services or view content provided by
                  {{@$seo->site_name}}, we may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs.
                  This may include:
                </li> <ol><li>details of how you used our Service.</li> <li>Internet protocol address.</li> <li>
                    device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware
                    settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your
                    request and referral URL.
                  </li> <li>Sites you visited before and after visiting our Site.</li> <li>
                    cookies and other technology that may uniquely identify your browser or
                    your Account (more information about cookies is below).
                  </li></ol> <li><strong>Interests and favorites.</strong> We collect data about your interests and favorites, such
                  as the Services you use most often, information from your responses to
                  questions, apps that you use, and teams you follow and other subjects or areas
                  of interest to you. In addition to those you explicitly provide, your interests and
                  favorites also may be inferred or derived from other data we collect.
                </li> <li><strong>Content.</strong> We collect the content of your files and communications when
                  necessary to provide you with the Services you use. For example, if you provide
                  us video, images or other media for sharing with others, we need to collect the
                  content of that file or information to display it and store it. We also collect the
                  content of messages you send to us, such as feedback, surveys and reviews you
                  write, or questions and information you provide for customer support. When you
                  contact us, such as for customer support, phone conversations or chat sessions
                  with our representatives may be monitored and recorded.
                </li> <li><strong>Location information.</strong> When you use a location-enabled Service, we may
                  collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent
                  by a mobile device. We also may use various technologies to determine location,
                  such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information
                  on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
                </li> <li><strong>Unique application numbers.</strong> Certain Services include a unique application
                  number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the
                  operating system type and application version number) may be sent to us when
                  you install or uninstall that Service or when that Service periodically contacts our
                  servers, such as for automatic updates.
                </li> <li><strong>Local storage.</strong> We may collect and store information (including Personal
                  Information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web
                  storage (including HTML5) and application data caches.
                </li></ol> <h3>COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h3> <p>
                As you interact with our Services, we and our service providers may place cookies and
                other technologies on your system. In general, these technologies can make the
                Internet more useful by storing information and other useful information about your
                preferences on a particular system. They can show us, for example, popular pages,
                conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information that can be used
                to improve, operate and monitor our Site and other aspects of our Services.
              </p> <p><i>Cookies</i></p> <p>
                We use "cookies" and other web technologies to collect information and support certain
                features of our Sites. A "cookie" is a small file that does not contain Personal
                Information and is saved on your computer or mobile device. Cookies help improve your
                user experience and allow us to analyze our Sites and manage our advertising.
              </p> <p>
                Our cookies help to give you faster access to pages you already have visited, allow you
                to personalize your pages, and allow us to customize our offerings. Cookies also help
                you to participate in some activities or events on our Sites and can keep track of items
                in your shopping cart or Account.
              </p> <p>
                The section below regarding your choices and rights will discuss your ability not to
                accept cookies. Please note that if you do not accept cookies or the other technologies
                described in this section, some features, activities or Services may not be available to
                you.
              </p> <p><i>Flash Cookies</i></p> <p>
                Flash cookies, also known as local shared objects ("LSOs"), are used with Adobe®
                Flash® Player. LSOs act like cookies in that they store information to provide you with a
                more customized experience, but LSOs can store complex data that cookies cannot,
                and LSOs are not deleted or rejected if you set your browser to delete or reject cookies.
                Although browser settings will not allow you to manage LSOs, you may be able to
                manage them in other ways.
              </p> <p><i>Web Beacons, Pixel Tags or Clear GIFs</i></p> <p>
                We also may use other technology, called web beacons, pixel tags or clear GIFs, to
                provide us with other important anonymous information, such as when an e-mail has
                been opened. Companies that advertise on our Sites may place web beacons in their
                ads to help develop statistics on the effectiveness of advertising at our Sites. We do not
                control web beacons in third party ads.
              </p> <h3>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3> <p>
                We use information we collect from you for a number of purposes and in a number of
                ways.
              </p> <ol><li>
                  We will use it for any purpose indicated at the time it is collected, e.g., if you
                  enter a contest, we may use your information to contact you about the contest; if
                  you purchase a Service, we use the information to supply the Service; if you sign
                  up for a newsletter, we will use the information to send you the newsletter; if you
                  send us a work application, we may review the application to assist in making
                  hiring decisions.
                </li> <li>
                  We may use information we collect from you (alone or combined with other

                  with law, protect intellectual property, and measure the effectiveness of our

                  that use cookies, flash cookies or other technology to help us better utilize and 
                  target advertising at our Sites. These technologies may keep track of the sites

                  used for the purpose of targeting advertisements on our Sites and other sites based 
                  on those interests and to learn which ads bring users to our Sites.

                {{@$seo->site_name}} is committed to maintaining your trust, and we want you to understand when and
                with whom we may share information collected about you.
              </p> <p><i>With Your Consent</i></p> <p>
                With your consent, we may share your Personal Information with third-party business
                partners and others included within your consent.
              </p> <p><i>Authorized Third-Party Service Providers</i></p> <p>
                We share your information with third-party vendors who help us with specialized
                services such as customer support, email and text message deployment, business
                analytics, marketing, and data processing. These third parties are allowed to use your
                information to help us provide our Services. For example, we may share information
                with partners that analyze data regarding sports performance, provide applications and
                services such as automatic calendaring, ticket processing or email-related services.
              </p> <p><i>Co-Branded Partners</i></p> <p>
                Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom we may jointly offer a service or 
                feature. You can tell when you are accessing a service offered by a Co-Branded Partner 
                because the Co-Branded Partner's name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to 
                provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a Co-Branded Partner. 
                In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Co-Branded Partner, or 
                we may share your information with the Co-Branded Partner. Co-Branded Partner sites may have 
                their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review.
              </p> <p><i>Third Party Advertisers</i></p> <p>
                Please note that we may share information with advertisers. We permit third party advertisers 
                such as CBS Interactive Inc. and its affiliates and partners ("Third-party Advertisers") to place 
                tags, scripts, and beacons ("Third-party Tags") on our Sites as part of the advertisements displayed 
                on our Sites. These third-party tags may set cookies on your device and also may gather information 
                about your device and the pages you visit on our site and on other sites that display third-party tags. 
                More information about those technologies can be found above. You should review the privacy policies 
                and notices of our Third-party Advertisers for more information about how they use the information 
                gathered through Third-party Tags. By visiting our Sites, you consent to the automatic collection 
                and use of information by our Third-party Advertisers as described in this Privacy Policy and as 
                described in the Third-party Advertisers’ privacy policies as posted from time to time.
              </p> <p>
                If streaming videos displayed on our sites include Third-party Tags, the third parties that
                have provided the Third-party Tags also may receive information about videos you
                watch on our Sites and Apps, and you consent to the sharing of this information.
              </p> <p>
                Our Sites use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party
                websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we
                advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, such as
                registering to become a member. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the
                Google search results page or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party
                vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to
                our Sites. Any data we collect will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and
                Google is responsible to abide by its own privacy policy. You can set your preferences
                for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page. You may opt
                out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings.
              </p> <p><i>Business Transfers</i></p> <p>
                We reserve the right to transfer information about you to a successor organization if, for
                example, we transfer the ownership of some or all of our assets, transfer operations of a
                Site, enter bankruptcy, or merge with another organization. If such a transfer occurs, we
                will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a
                manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. Following such a sale or transfer, you may
                contact the entity to which we transferred your Personal Information with any inquiries
                concerning the processing of that information.
              </p> <p><i>Legal Requirements</i></p> <p>
                We may disclose information about our users, including contact information, to respond
                to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, and other law enforcement measures, and to
                comply with other legal obligations, such as FCC requirements.
              </p> <p><i>Protect Our Sites and Users</i></p> <p>
                If {{@$seo->site_name}} believes that anyone’s use of the Services may damage us, our Services, or
                any person or property, we may use or disclose relevant Personal Information to
                prevent such harm. We also may disclose information about you when we, in good faith,
                believe disclosure is appropriate in order to: comply with the law, a court order, or a
                subpoena; prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft;
                protect the security of our Sites or Apps; enforce or apply our Terms of Use or other
                agreements; or protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or safety of our
                users or others.
              </p> <p><i>Non-Personal Information</i></p> <p>
                We share information that is Non-Personal Information and may do so for any reason.
                Likewise, we may share aggregated or anonymized information (information that has

                You may elect to share information about your use of the Services, e.g., the {{@$seo->site_name}}
                Network Service, including what you watch, within the Services as well as on social
                networks. If any of the Services permit leaving comments, any comments you share or
                other information you disclose will be generally available for anyone to view, and you
                should not share any information that you would not want further disclosed.
              </p> <p>
                One or more of the Services may enable you to post content to a social network service
                ("SNS") such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn. If you choose to do this, we will provide
                information to such SNS. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible
                for your use of each SNS and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and
                privacy policy of the third party provider of such SNS. We will not be liable for: (i) the
                availability or accuracy of such SNS; (ii) the content, products or services on or
                availability of such SNS; or (iii) your use of any SNS.

                We may use your e-mail address or other methods to send you newsletters, as well as
                messages about new site features, special offers, promotional announcements,
                consumer surveys and other correspondence concerning our Services. If you no longer
                want to receive marketing promotions from us, simply use your Account name and

                that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us that is not primarily
                marketing, including messages relating to your Account transactions.
              </p> <p><i>Rewards Programs, Contests, Etc.</i></p> <p>
                Enrolling in a {{@$seo->site_name}} rewards program or contest is completely voluntary. When you
                enroll in a rewards program or contest, we will collect Personal Information about you
                that may include your name, address, email, phone number, images and/or other
                information. We store this information so that we can administer the program properly,
                process your rewards and winnings (if any), and communicate offers to you based on
                your interests. From time to time, we may ask you to supply other information about
                your household’s consumer interests. Certain information may be required in order to
                participate in a rewards program or contest and other information may be voluntary. If
                you do not wish to provide any mandatory information, you may choose not to
                participate in any rewards program or contest.
              </p> <p>
                Each rewards program and contest may have additional terms and conditions or
                policies that supersede this Privacy Policy. Please review the Terms of Use and any
                terms and policies connected with each such program and contest.
              </p> <h3>YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES</h3> <p>
                People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information
                we collect and how we use and disclose it so that you can make meaningful choices
                about how it is used. For example, your Account settings may permit you to manage
                your preferences. The following are some of the rights and responsibilities that you have
                concerning the privacy of your information.
              </p> <p><i>Cookies</i></p> <p>
                As we noted above, you may set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies
                associated with our Services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. The Help
                portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
                accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new
                cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please remember that if your browser is
                set not to accept any cookies, you likely will not be able to use the {{@$seo->site_name}} Services or
                Sites or enjoy full functionality of the Services.
              </p> <p>
                We also may personalize your experience on our sites and mobile Services by showing
                you advertisements from {{@$seo->site_name}} or our advertising partners that are tailored to your
                interests.
              </p> <p><i>Information You Share.</i></p> <p>
                Many of our Services let you share information with others. Remember that when you
                share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines. Our Services provide
                you with different options on sharing and removing your content.
              </p> <p><i>Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information.</i></p> <p>
                If you choose to share contact information with us, you may have the opportunity to
                update that information on our Site. You also may update or amend your information by
                contacting us. If you ask us to deactivate your Account, we will disable your Account
                within a reasonable period of time. Please note that we may retain some information
                about you in order to address legal and security concerns. For example, some of your
                information may remain in back-up storage even if you ask us to delete it. In some
                cases, you may be entitled under local laws to access or object to the processing of
                information that we hold relating to you.
              </p> <p>
                We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate
                technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an
                existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be impractical (for instance,
                requests concerning information residing on backup systems).
              </p> <p>
                Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except
                where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our Services in a
                manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of
                this, after you delete information from our Services, we may not immediately delete
                residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our
                backup systems.
              </p> <p>
                Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made by contacting Customer Support
                as provided below.
              </p> <p><i>Do Not Track</i></p> <p>
                Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to
                operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral
                advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online
                activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not
                Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online
                activity while you are using our Services. We do not collect online activity after you
                leave our Services.
              </p> <p><i>Apps</i></p> <p>
                When you download or purchase an app developed by {{@$seo->site_name}}, or make an in-app
                purchase, you may do so through a third party application online store such as Apple’s
                App Store. When downloading an app, or using an app with on-line features through
                your platform, the app provider will typically also collect certain device and app-related
                information. We do not control the requirements or policies of app stores. Please review
                the privacy policy and terms of use of the mobile app stores before downloading or
                using any app, and check your device settings for control options. You may review

                This section is applicable to residents of California. If you are a resident of California, you have certain rights described below. The following do not apply to individuals who do not live in California on a permanent basis.
              </p> <h3 class="small">RIGHTS PROVIDED BY CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1798.83 </h3> <p>
                A  California  resident  who  has  provided  personal  data  to  a  business  with  whom  he/she  has established  a  business  relationship  for  personal,  family,  or  household  purposes  (a  "California Customer")   may   request   information   about   whether   the   business   has   disclosed   personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business  has  made  such  a  disclosure  of  personal  data,  upon  receipt  of  a  request  by  a  California Customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal data was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal data that were disclosed. California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by mailing us at {{@$seo->site_name}} Network, LLC, 2990 Brandywine Road, Suite 300, Atlanta, Georgia 30341, Attn: Legal Department or emailing {{@$seo->site_name}} Network, LLC at <a href="mailto:ccpa@playonsports.com">ccpa@playonsports.com</a>.  Please  note  that  we  are  only  required  to  respond  to  two requests per California Customer each year under Code Section 1798.83. 
              </p> <p><i>You have a Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Disclosed, or Sold.</i></p> <p>
                California residents have the right to request that {{@$seo->site_name}} Network disclose what personal information it collects, uses, discloses, and sells. This is called the “Right to Know”. Under the Right to Know, you can request a listing of the types of personal information we have collected about you, the sources of that information, how we use the information (e.g., our business or commercial purposes for collecting or selling personal information), other individuals and business with whom we share personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you. 
                If you would like the above information, you may contact us through our webpage or customer service. Contact information is at the bottom of this section. When you make a request under your Right to Know, you can expect the following:
              </p> <ol><li>We will verify your identity. You will need to provide us the following: (i) your first and last name and email address; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</li> <li>We will confirm our receipt of your request within 10 days. If you have not received a response within a few days after that, please let us know by contacting us at the webpage or phone number listed below.</li> <li>We will respond to your request within 45 days. If necessary, we may need an additional period of time, up to another 45 days, but we will reply either way within the first 45-day period and, if we need an extension, we will explain why.</li> <li>In certain cases, a Request to Know may be denied, for example, if we cannot verify your identity or if providing you the information could create an unreasonable risk to someone’s security (for example, we do not want very sensitive information disclosed inappropriately). If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it. If we deny a request, we will still try to provide you as much of the information as we can, but we will withhold the information subject to denial.</li></ol> <p>
                “Personal information,” for purposes of this section regarding the rights of California residents, does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.
              </p> <p>{{@$seo->site_name}} Network does <i>not</i> sell personal information of minors under 16 years of age.</p> <p><i>You have a Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information about You.</i></p> <p>
                California consumers have a right to request the deletion of their personal information collected or maintained by {{@$seo->site_name}} Network. If you would like information about you to be deleted, you may contact us through our webpage or customer service. Contact information is at the bottom of this section. When you make a request for deletion, you can expect the following:
              </p> <ol><li>After you request deletion, you will need to confirm that you want your information deleted.</li> <li>We will verify your identity. You will need to provide us the following: (i) your first and last name and email address; and and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</li> <li>We will confirm our receipt of your request within 10 days. If you have not received a response within a few days after that, please let us know by contacting us at the webpage or phone number listed below.</li> <li>We will respond to your request within 45 days. If necessary, we may need an additional period of time, up to another 45 days, but we will reply either way within the first 45-day period and, if we need an extension, we will explain why.</li> <li>In certain cases, a request for deletion may be denied, for example, if we cannot verify your identity, the law requires that we maintain the information (e.g., in case of a recall) or if we need the information for internal purposes such as keeping records of any warranties. If we deny your request, we will explain why we denied it, treat your request an “opt-out” of the sale of information (as described in our Notice of Right to Opt-Out), and delete any other information that is not protected from deletion. </li></ol> <p><i>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</i></p> <p>
                You have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment by {{@$seo->site_name}} Network for exercising any of your privacy rights conferred by the CCPA. {{@$seo->site_name}} Network will not discriminate against any California consumer because such person exercised any of the consumer’s rights under CCPA, including, but not limited to:
              </p> <ol><li>Denying goods or services.</li> <li>Charging different prices or rates for goods and services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.</li> <li>We will confirm our receipt of your request within 10 days. If you have not received a response within a few days after that, please let us know by contacting us at the webpage or phone number listed below.</li> <li>Providing a different level or quality of goods or services.</li> <li>Suggesting that the consumer will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li></ol> <p>
                {{@$seo->site_name}} Network may, however, charge a different price or rate, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services, if that difference is related to the value provided to you by your data.

                If you would like, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We will deny requests from agents that do not submit proof of authorization from you. To verify that an authorized agent has authority to act for you, we may require a copy of a power of attorney or require that you provide the authorized agent with written permission and verify your own identity with us.

                {{@$seo->site_name}} takes information security very seriously and uses reasonable administrative,
                technical, physical and administrative measures to protect your Personal Information
                from unauthorized access. Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be
                100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and
                cannot assume liability for improper access to it. By using our Services, including our
                Site or App and user interfaces, or providing information to us through any means, you
                agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and
                administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. You are responsible for
                maintaining the confidentiality of your Account access information and for restricting
                access to your computer or device through which you access your {{@$seo->site_name}} Account. If
                you disclose your password to anyone or share your Account and/or devices with other
                people, you take full responsibility for their actions. Where possible, users of public or
                shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a
                computer or device, you should log-out and deactivate the device and delete all
                information on the device by a process that ensures complete removal. If you fail to log
                out and deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your Account
                information.
              </p> <p><i>Location of Data and Data Transfers</i></p> <p>
                Our Services are solely intended for individuals located within the United States and its
                territories and are subject to U.S. law. If you are located outside of the United States
                and its territories, please do not use the Services. By utilizing the Services, you consent 
                to the transfer of your data to the United States and its maintenance in the United States.
              </p> <p>
                We may transfer the Personal Information we collect about you to countries other than
                the country in which the information was originally collected. Those countries may not
                have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the
                information. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that
                information as described in this Privacy Policy.
              </p> <h3>USE OF OUR WEB SITES BY CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTEEN</h3> <p>
                We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about Site or App users who are under 
                the age of 13. Furthermore, we do not intentionally allow Site or App users under the age 
                of 18 (or older if the age of majority is more than 18). If you are a minor, please do not 
                provide us any Personal Information or use the Services without receiving your parent’s 
                or guardian’s permission. If a child under 13 submits Personal Information to {{@$seo->site_name}} and we 
                learn that the Personal Information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt 
                to delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any Personal 
                Information from a child under 13, please contact us at: {{@$seo->site_name}} Network, LLC, 2990 Brandywine Road,

              </p> <h3>PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES</h3> <p>
                This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any material
                changes in the way we collect, use, or disclose your Personal Information, we will post a
                notice on the Sites and within the Apps. You should look at this Privacy Policy regularly.
                Any changes will be effective immediately for new users of a Service and effective thirty
                (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site for current
                Account holders. If you object to any such changes, you must notify us prior to the
                effective date of such changes that you wish to deactivate your Account with us.
                Continued use of our Services following the effective date of any such changes shall
                indicate your acceptance of such changes. If you do not agree to the modified
                provisions of this Privacy Policy, you should discontinue your use of the Services.
